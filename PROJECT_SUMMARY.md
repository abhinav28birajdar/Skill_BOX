   - These will be resolved once Supabase is configured
   - All errors are related to database operations

2. **Missing Environment Variables**: 
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY

3. **Database Not Connected**: SQL schema needs to be deployed to Supabase

## 🚀 Next Steps to Make It Fully Functional

### 1. Setup Supabase (15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Go to https://supabase.com and create a new project
# 2. Copy your project URL and anon key
# 3. Run the SQL schema from database/complete_schema.sql
# 4. Update .env file with your credentials
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example file and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env

# Add your actual values:
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
```

### 3. Generate Supabase Types (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Generate TypeScript types
supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > types/supabase.ts
```

### 4. Test the Application
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Test on your device or simulator
# All TypeScript errors should be resolved
```

### 5. Optional: Setup Additional Services
- **OpenAI API**: For AI Study Assistant features
- **Firebase**: For push notifications (optional)
- **Analytics**: For usage tracking (optional)
